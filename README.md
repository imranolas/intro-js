# An Intro to Javascript
Starter pack for an intro to Javascript bootcamp at General Assemb.ly

This pack contains the starter code for the exercises we'll cover in class. There are also completed examples for the project exercises we'll be tackling on the second day. I'd recommend abstaining from viewing the completed code so as not to ruin the surprise. :)

If you have any questions regarding the examples, your code or the bootcamp in general please don't hesitate to get in touch, regardless of whether you have attended the course.
